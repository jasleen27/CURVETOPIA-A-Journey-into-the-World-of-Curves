Symmetry Detection in Curves

Key Components

Find All Symmetry Lines
Function: find_all_symmetry_lines(points)
Description: Computes potential symmetry lines for a set of points. The function identifies vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines of symmetry by calculating the mean of x and y coordinates and diagonal line equations.
Parameters:
points: A numpy array of shape (n, 2) representing the coordinates of the closed shape.
Returns: A list of lines, each defined by coefficients [a, b, c] in the line equation ax + by + c = 0.

Plotting Function
Function: plot(points, lines)
Description: Visualizes the given shape and the detected lines of symmetry. It plots the curve and overlays the symmetry lines on the same graph.
Parameters:
points: A numpy array of shape (n, 2) representing the coordinates of the closed shape.
lines: A list of lines to plot, each defined by coefficients [a, b, c].
Output: Displays a plot with the shape and symmetry lines.
