Using mathematical logic in Identifying Regular Shapes from Curves

Straight Lines
Description: Curves with constant direction and zero curvature.
Detection: Identify collinear points using angles or distances between segments.

Circles and Ellipses
Description: Circles have all points equidistant from a center; ellipses have points with a constant sum of distances from two foci.
Detection: For circles, check equidistance from a center. For ellipses, verify distance sums from two focal points.

Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles
Description: Rectangles have four right angles; rounded rectangles have curved edges.
Detection: Identify right angles for rectangles; distinguish straight from curved edges for rounded rectangles.

Regular Polygons
Description: Shapes with equal side lengths and angles (e.g., triangles, squares).
Detection: Check for equal side lengths and angles.

Star Shapes
Description: Shapes with a central point and multiple radial arms.
Detection: Detect a central point and analyze radial symmetry.
