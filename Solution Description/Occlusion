Completing Incomplete Curves

Solution Approach

Detect Occlusions (detect_occlusions)
Objective: Identify intersections between curve segments to locate occlusions.
Description: This function analyzes curves to detect overlapping segments, highlighting where gaps or occlusions occur.

Visualize Occlusions (plot_with_occlusions)
Objective: Display the curves and highlight the detected occlusions.
Description: Plots the curves and highlights occluded segments to visualize the areas needing completion.

Complete Occluded Segments (complete_occluded_segments)
Objective: Restore missing parts of the curves based on detected gaps.
Description: Uses linear interpolation to complete the occluded segments, ensuring a smooth and natural restoration.
