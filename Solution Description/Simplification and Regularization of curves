Used Ramer-Douglas-Peucker Algorithm for curve simplification
Ramer-Douglas-Peucker Algorithm
Purpose: Simplify a curve by reducing the number of points while preserving its shape.

Steps
Initialization:

Start with a set of points representing the curve.
Find Maximum Distance:

Identify the point farthest from the line segment connecting the start and end points of the curve.
Check Distance Threshold:

If this distance is greater than a threshold (ε), keep the point; otherwise, approximate the curve with the line segment.
Recursive Simplification:

Apply the algorithm recursively to the segments created by the farthest point.
Combine Results:

Merge the simplified segments into the final curve.

Key Parameter
Epsilon (ε): Distance threshold for point significance. Smaller ε means more accuracy; larger ε means more simplification.
